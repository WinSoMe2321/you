<p>I didn’t want to step into a new year without speaking from my heart.</p>
<p>Not loudly, not dramatically — just honestly.</p>
<p>Last year taught me many things, but the most important one was you.</p>
<p>Your presence has a quiet way of making everything feel steady.</p>
<p>In moments of doubt, you became my calm.</p>
<p>In moments of happiness, you became my reason.</p>
<p><b>Because you are everything I pray for.</b></p>
